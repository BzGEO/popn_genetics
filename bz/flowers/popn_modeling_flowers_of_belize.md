# Population Modeling: the Flowers Family of Belize
*Last updated: 11.01.2026*

**Research question:** How do we model the growth of the Flowers family from a small founder population in 1787 to approximately 2,500 individuals with that surname in 2014?

*Assumptions:* The ~2,500 individuals in 2014 *with the surname Flowers* are only a fraction of the people descended from the original founder population. That is, because of how surnames are passed on, many more people will be descended from a founder population than possess their surnames.

**Facts**

* **1786**: ~700 inhabitants in the Bay Colony, prior to the arrival of people from the Mosquito Shore
* **1790**: ~2,915 inhabitants in Belize (Bay Colony) -> *~2,212 people originally from the Mosquito Shore, so a ratio of 3:1 (Mosquito Shore: Bay Colony)*
* **1816**: 3,824 inhabitants
* **1823**: 4,107 inhabitants
* **1891**: 31,471 inhabitants
* **1901**: 37,179 inhabitants

**Flowers population**
* 1812: 50 individuals (of approx. 3,000 inhabitants) -> assume 25 men, 25 women
