# Population modeling: the Flowers family of Belize

**Research question:** How do we model the growth of the Flowers family from a small founder population in 1787 to approximately 2,500 individuals with that surname in 2014?

*Assumptions:* The ~2,500 individuals in 2014 with the surname Flowers are only a fraction of the people descended from the original founder population. That is, because of how surnames are passed on, many more people will be descended from a founder population than possess their surnames.
