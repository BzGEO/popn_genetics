# Population modeling: the Flowers family of Belize
*Last updated: 11.01.2026*

**Research question:** How do we model the growth of the Flowers family from a small founder population in 1787 to approximately 2,500 individuals with that surname in 2014?

*Assumptions:* The ~2,500 individuals in 2014 *with the surname Flowers* are only a fraction of the people descended from the original founder population. That is, because of how surnames are passed on, many more people will be descended from a founder population than possess their surnames.

**Facts**

* **1790**: ~2,915 inhabitants in Belize (Bay Colony) -> *~2,212 people originally from the Mosquito Shore, so a ratio of 3:1 (Mosquito Shore: Bay Colony)* (source: Bennett, 2017)
