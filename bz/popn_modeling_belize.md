# Population Modeling: the Flowers Family of Belize
*Last updated: 15.01.2026*

## Research questions
* How do we model the growth of the Flowers family from a small founder population in 1787 to approximately 2,500 individuals with that surname in 2014?

### Assumptions
* The ~2,500 individuals in 2014 *with the surname Flowers* are only a fraction of the people descended from the original founder population. That is, because of how surnames are passed on, many more people will be descended from a founder population than possess their surnames.

## Population statistics

### National population
**Belizean [population](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/0B_eQWO64TxDbNnNfbFpSalZCYU0/edit?resourcekey=0-YJ0wS6Npc1_m2bOcyXGUXQ&gid=348434329#gid=348434329)**
* **1786**: ~700 inhabitants in the Bay Colony, prior to the arrival of people from the Mosquito Shore
* **1790**: ~2,915 inhabitants in Belize (Bay Colony) -> *~2,212 people originally from the Mosquito Shore, so a ratio of 3:1 (Mosquito Shore: Bay Colony)*
* **1816**: 3,824 inhabitants
* **1823**: 4,107 inhabitants
* **1891**: 31,471 inhabitants
* **1901**: 37,179 inhabitants
* **1921**: 45,317 inhabitants
* **1931**: 51,347 inhabitants
* **1946**: 59,220 inhabitants
* **1960**: 90,505 inhabitants
* **1970**: 119,934 inhabitants
* **1980**: 145,353 inhabitants
* **1991**: 189,392 inhabitants
* **2000**: 246,538 inhabitants
* **2010**: 322,453 inhabitants
* **2017**: 387,879 inhabitants
* **2022**: 397,483 inhabitants

***Considerations**: Important junctures
  * 1787: Arrival of the evacuees from the Mosquito Shore settlements (present-day Honduras and Nicaragua)
  * c. 1900: Arrival of refugees from the Caste War in Mexico
  * c. 1985: Arrival of refugees from the Central American civil wars (Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua)

***Sources**: 1786 and 1790 data from Bennett (2017), 1816 and 1823 data from Hadel (1974), 1891 and 1901 data from the British Honduras Census (1901), 1921-2010 data from the Statistical Institute of Belize (2012), 2017 data from the Statistical Institute of Belize (2017), and 2022 data from the Statistical Institute of Belize (2024)*

### Population: Flowers family
* 1812: 50 individuals (of approx. 3,000 inhabitants) -> assume 25 men, 25 women
* 2014: ~2,487 individuals (of approx. 352,266 individuals) -> 0.706% of total population -> SIB official estimates (2024) for 2014 were 349,169 inhabitants

**Flowers population: Modeling**
* A [simple model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1toAYGXuRx3_Ak5Y6yA3Kb7PinnANQxed/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=105196094871740597688&rtpof=true&sd=true) tracking the growth of the Flowers family has been constructed, estimating that the family doubles every two generations, taking the population from approximately 50 individuals in 1800 to approx. 2,400 individuals by 2020. For each generation, we estimate a male / female sex ratio of 1:1. Only the male members of the population are estimated to pass along the Flowers surname.
