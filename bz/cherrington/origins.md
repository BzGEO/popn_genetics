# A genealogist's journey: Exploring the why
*Last updated: 05.01.2026*

* Circa 1989: As a child, my parents and I would visit my mother's aunt **Ivy Perera (nee Leacock)** in Belmopan on Easter weekend of every year. Other family members would also visit. I must have been eight or nine (so likely late March 1989 or mid-April 1990) when one Easter Sunday night, the discussion of the evening focused on the family history of my mother's side of the family. I recall the discussion focusing on how we were a mix of [Creole (*Kriol*)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belizean_Creole_people), German, British, Spanish, and [Amerindian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas) ([Maya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_peoples)). I was fascinated because even though by that time I'd learned in my Social Studies classes at [Saint Joseph's](https://stjosephbz.weebly.com/) that Creole was a melange of African and British, what the discussions of our family's history indicated was that my family was even more mixed than perhaps the *average* Belizean family, particularly a Creole Belizean family.
* Circa 1994: A few years after the discussion of family history at Aunt Ivy's house in Belmopan, circa 1994, I saw an early episode of the *Highlander* TV show about an immortal from Scotland. In that early episode, the eponymous Highlander, Duncan MacLeod, has a flashback to just after he became an immortal. He recalls running after his adoptive father, who is seen riding away on horseback, and he screams, "*Where do I come from?! Where do I come from?!*" That scene likewise made an impression on me.
* Circa 1994: I had to make some sort of rudimentary family tree for my second year history class at the prestigious [St. John's College (SJC)](https://www.sjc.edu.bz/) in Belize City. My father (**Glenn Cherrington**) was able to provide some limited details on his side of the family.
    * His mother **Amyline Cherrington (nee Young)** had passed away in November 1991 and he had said that she was the keeper of knowledge of the Young and Cherrington sides of my father's family. My father said that Amy's mother, **Fernanda Ortega**, had been born in the Peten in neighboring Guatemala, and that Amy's father, **John Young**, was a tall "red skinned" (i.e., lightskinned) Creole man.
    * My father and his siblings affirmed that their father **Herman Cherrington**'s mother, **Eusebia Zelaya**, had spoken Spanish and was Hispanic. My grandfather - who could not recall the names of *his* grandparents - affirmed that his Cherrington grandfather had been "a white man," but I would later discover that this could not have been true, although his grandfather's *grandfather*, **William Taylor Cherrington**, was indeed a Caucasian man from England. Herman Cherrington's father, **Josiah Cherrington**, had been born in the village of [Mullins River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mullins_River) in Stann Creek, as had Herman himself, and Herman's siblings.
* Circa 1995: While attending high school at SJC (Aug. 1993 - May 1997), I would spend every Friday evening visiting my maternal grandmother, **Rita Leacock (nee Encalada)** at her home on Vernon Street in Belize City. We would speak about her family, and I would ask her about her memories of her own grandparents and great grandparents, where applicable. One evening, she was visited by a nun, **Sister Louise**, who was a distant relative and who was trying to construct a family tree and to document who our ancestors were. I don't recall what came of the effort, but I recall my grandmother commenting that some gentleman named **Busman Arnold** who lived somewhere in central Belize was a relative of ours and of Sister Louise and that the nun had visited him to learn family lore.
* Late 1999: I am in my first semester at [Loyola College in Maryland](https://www.loyola.edu/) (which has since been renamed Loyola University Maryland). I am a junior Biology major, and in May 2001, I will graduate *Summa Cum Laude* with a Bachelor of Science degree, but in ~December 1999, I am selecting classes for the second semester of my junior year. I select a *Molecular Genetics* course with Prof. Neena Din, because of my interest in inheritance. Years later, I will come to understand that had Loyola offered a *Human Population Genetics* course, the course of my professional life would likely have been very different. I take Prof. Din's course between January and May 2000, and I come out of it with an A grade. At the end of that spring semester, Prof. Din offers for me to shadow two of the students working in her lab, who are doing genetic analyses using the PCR technique, but I am not really interested in molecular genetics. In my final two semesters at Loyola (Fall 2000 through Spring 2001), I will end up doing undergraduate level research with a different professor, plant ecologist [Dr. Bernadette Roche](https://www.loyola.edu/academics/biology/faculty/roche-bernadette.html).
* February 2014: I submitted a saliva sample to the company 23andMe, and that rekindled my interest in genetics. I was somehow able to convince my mother, two of her sisters, two of my maternal cousins, my mother's paternal aunt, and my father to submit samples [as well as my wife and multiple members of her family].
   * The 23andMe results eventually confirm what is already known in my mother's family - that my maternal grandfather **Ramsay Gordon Leacock, Sr.** is not the son of **Ivan Leacock**, but that he is in fact the son of **Dr. Karl Stanislaus Heusner**. This has been something of a sore point in our family because even though the late Dr. Heusner - the first Belizean to become a medical doctor, and the namesake of Belize's largest hospital - acknowledged my grandfather and his two sisters (Ishbel and Ivy), a few family members dispute that my grandfather was a Heusner. The 23andMe results essentially put the matter to rest.
   * The 23andMe results also help to address a family mystery, namely the parentage of my grandfather's mother (**Avis Viola Leacock, nee Peters**). Avis' father was not known, and there were two contrary accounts of who her father might have been. My grandfather's cousin Ruth Stewart had indicated that Avis' father was a bootlegger named John (surname unknown) who had died trying to outrun authorities chasing his boat. My grandmother recounted that Avis' father might have been her mother's half-brother. What 23andMe indicated, however, was that unlike the scores of other Belizeans in 23andMe's database, my maternal grandfather's kin all had relatives from Cape Verde (Cabo Verde). Some sleuthing revealed that one **Pedro Pereira** from Cape Verde had moved to British Honduras in the early 1900s, married a local woman and had a handful of children with her before emigrating to Hawaii. The fact that I, my mother, her sisters, and her aunt (my grandfather's sister) are also related to the descendants of Pedro Pereira points to a likely candidate for Avis' father - Pedro Pereira himself, as my great grandmother was born in Belize in the period of time that Mr. Pereira resided in Belize. Somehow, Mr. Pereira and Avis' mother - **Mabel Peters** - must have had some daliance, and my great grandmother was the result. I even have a spreadsheet documenting calculations used to support that assessment ("dna_comparisons_cape_verde_jan2016.xlsx").
* March 2014: Via 23andMe, I am contacted by a distant relative, **Akeem Genus**, who has been implementing a "Belize Ancestry Project" as a pet side project. I am impressed by Akeem's dedication to learn more about the genetic ethnic makeup of Belizeans. He documents this information in his spare time, despite having a day job and other commitments. By coincidence, Akeem is the nephew of **Allen Genus**, who had been one of my internship supervisors at the Toledo Institute for Development and Environment (TIDE) when I was a graduate student intern in the summer of 2003. Allen Genus had been TIDE's Operations Director. It was fascinating to consider that I had been working with a relative and I was unaware of the fact. That said, to this day (Jan. 2026), I still have not yet discovered how specifically I am related to Akeem Genus, but that will be a common thread with the vast majority of the relatives I discover through 23andMe, Ancestry DNA, and Family Tree DNA.
* June 2014: Partly as a result of having been fascinated by my 23andMe results, for a ~three month spell, I was convinced that my direct paternal ancestor William T. Cherrington wanted me to uncover his story.
* August 2014: The week before my father (**Glenn Alvin Cherrington**) passed away, I was on a work trip to Belmopan (specifically, a consultancy with the University of Belize's Environmental Research Institute), I had a free morning and I visited the Belize Archives and Records Service (BARS). Two of the archivists there, Mary Alpuche and Yobani Aguilar, were *extremely* helpful, and facilitated access to a number of records that helped fill in gaps in my Cherrington family history in particular. I was able to hold in my hands the [last will and testament of **William T. Cherrington**](https://github.com/BzGEO/popn_genetics/blob/main/bz/cherrington/wm_cherrington_will_1830.md), from 1830. I thought about the almost two hundred years that had passed and all of the knowledge of our family that had essentially been lost, because that knowledge had *not* been handed down.
* August 2014: The Sunday I returned to France from Belize, my copies of the three Parish Registers of British Honduras (compiled by Sonia Bennett Murray) arrived. These documents added information to what I'd been able to discover during my first trip to Belize's national archives.
* September 2014: By the end of the previous month, mirroring the work of Akeem Genus, I had created a small database of 102 Belizeans / descendants of Belizeans who had submitted samples to 23andMe. I and members of my family were related to 45.1% of the 94 Belizeans who were not close family members. Also, we had no idea how we were related to most of those Belizeans. It was interesting to find out that we were related to a member of Belize's prominent Hyde family, the implication being that we *might* be distant cousins to the larger **Hyde-Lindo family**.
* 11 September 2025: On a work trip to Belize, I took my University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) supervisor to my Aunt Carolyn's house for dinner. She commented to my supervisor that I was our family's "keeper of the knowledge" and he laughed, as if this was some formal role.
* 5 January 2026: I have begun this GitHub page as a way to document the various things I have learned about my own family history over the years. **I hope that this survives in some form and that my own descendants [or perhaps other relatives] will find this useful.** I wonder about the stories of the people who came before me, whose genetic contributions gave rise to the physical body that I have.
    * I particularly wonder about the Creole ancestors I had, who likely inhabited parts of the Belize River Valley, and what their lives were like, and what traditions and beliefs they held, in the 200+ years of inhabiting a specific corner of Central America.
    * One reason that the [concept of the] stories of my ancestors' lives fascinate me is that a tiny portion of my Christmas vacation has been spent listening to family stories told by my mother-in-law. I realize that a wealth of stories can be told about just a handful of individuals from one of two generations. My mother-in-law's recollections center on lives lived in the Departments of Jutiapa and Jalapa in southeastern Guatemala. Those tales focus on large families, occupations, achievements, inheritances, and marriage customs, among other things. Since those are not *my* stories to tell, I only provide a summary here.
