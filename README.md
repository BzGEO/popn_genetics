  * "In Africa, studies have shown that different tribal and language groups have moved over time, displacing others and mixing genetically. Cameroon, an area associated with Bantu languages, for example, was occupied by an entirely different people 3,000 to 8,000 years ago, Reich said."
  * "Reich said... "People in Colombia have almost no local Y-chromosomes. They’re almost all European. And they have almost no European mitochondrial DNAs (inherited through the mother). They’re almost all Native American." "
  * " "The big perspective change from ancient DNA study is that people living today are almost never the descendants of the people in the same place thousands of years before," Reich said."
